# Implementing Bookstore API Based on Specification

## Requirements
- Implement the Bookstore API based on the API specification
- Create the required endpoints for all entities (Books, Authors, Categories, Publishers, Customers, Orders, Reviews, Cart)
- Organize endpoints using extension methods for better maintainability
- Follow clean architecture principles with separation of concerns
- Implement proper request processors for each endpoint
- Return hardcoded responses for now (no database context implementation yet)

## Additional comments from user
- The API should be implemented in the existing ASP.NET Core Minimal API project
- Database context implementation is not needed yet, use hardcoded responses

## Plan

## Decisions
- Will use extension methods to organize endpoints by entity type
- Will implement request processors with hardcoded data for now
- Will follow the endpoint patterns defined in the API specification
- Will organize code following clean architecture principles
- Will use OpenAPI/Swagger tags to group endpoints by entity type for better organization in Swagger UI

## Implementation Details
The API implementation includes:

1. **Project Structure**
   - Organized endpoints into extension method classes for better maintainability
   - Created DTO models for all entities (Book, Author, Category, Publisher, Customer, Order, Review, Cart)
   - Implemented request/response models following a consistent pattern

2. **Request Processors**
   - Implemented request processors with hardcoded responses for testing
   - Followed the pattern of having dedicated processors for each operation

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Implemented GET endpoints for all major entities
   - Organized endpoints using extension methods
   - Added proper response types and status codes

4. **OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation**
   - Added summary and description to all endpoints
   - Used tags to group endpoints by entity type
   - Configured proper response types for better documentation
   - Set Swagger UI as the root page for better discoverability

## Changes Made
1. Created extension method classes for all entities:
   - BookEndpoints.cs
   - AuthorEndpoints.cs
   - CategoryEndpoints.cs
   - PublisherEndpoints.cs
   - CustomerEndpoints.cs
   - OrderEndpoints.cs
   - ReviewEndpoints.cs
   - CartEndpoints.cs

2. Implemented DTO classes for all entities:
   - CategoryDto
   - PublisherDto
   - CustomerDto
   - OrderDto and OrderItemDto
   - ReviewDto
   - CartDto and CartItemDto

3. Implemented request processors with hardcoded data:
   - GetCategory and GetAllCategories
   - GetPublisher and GetAllPublishers
   - GetCustomer and GetAllCustomers
   - GetOrder and GetAllOrders

4. Updated Program.cs to:
   - Register all request processors
   - Configure enhanced Swagger UI
   - Use extension methods for endpoint mapping

5. Added OpenAPI documentation to all endpoints with:
   - Summary and description
   - Response types
   - Entity tags for grouping

## Before/After Comparison
### Before
- Bookstore API project exists but endpoints are not implemented
- Project structure follows clean architecture but lacks entity endpoints
- Minimal implementation with only a few sample endpoints

### After
- Comprehensive API with endpoints for all entities
- Well-organized code structure with extension methods
- Request processors returning sample data for testing
- Full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
