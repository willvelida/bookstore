# Requirements

- Expand the capabilities of the `Bookstore.Api.http` file
- Test all HTTP endpoints within the `Bookstore.Api` project

# Additional comments from user

No additional comments were provided.

# Plan

## Phase 1: Analyze Existing Endpoints
- [x] Task 1.1: Identify all controller endpoints in the Bookstore.Api project
- [x] Task 1.2: Determine endpoint structures (routes, HTTP methods, parameters)

## Phase 2: Expand HTTP Test File
- [x] Task 2.1: Organize endpoints by controller/entity
- [x] Task 2.2: Implement HTTP tests for each endpoint
- [x] Task 2.3: Add appropriate headers and comments for readability

# Decisions

- Organized HTTP tests by endpoint categories (Books, Authors, Categories, etc.)
- Used clear, descriptive comments to label each endpoint test
- Used a consistent format for all HTTP requests
- Maintained the existing host address variable for flexibility

# Implementation Details

The implementation focused on expanding the `Bookstore.Api.http` file to include tests for all API endpoints in the Bookstore.Api project. The file was structured to group endpoints by entity type.

Key implementation details:
- Used the existing `@Bookstore.Api_HostAddress` variable
- Organized endpoints by entity type (Books, Authors, Categories, etc.)
- Added clear comments for each endpoint
- Used consistent formatting for all requests

# Changes Made

Modified the following file:
- `c:\Users\velidawill\Documents\GitHub\bookstore\src\backend\Bookstore.Api\Bookstore.Api.http`

The file was expanded to include HTTP tests for all available API endpoints, including:
- Book endpoints (GET by ID)
- Author endpoints (GET by ID)
- Category endpoints (GET all and GET by ID)  
- Publisher endpoints (GET all and GET by ID)
- Customer endpoints (GET all and GET by ID)
- Order endpoints (GET all and GET by ID)
- Review endpoints (GET by book ID)
- Cart endpoints (GET by customer ID)

# Before/After Comparison

**Before**: The HTTP file may have had limited endpoint tests.

**After**: The HTTP file now includes comprehensive tests for all API endpoints, organized by entity type with clear comments.
