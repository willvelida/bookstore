# Bookstore Project Cleanup

## Requirements
- Clean up redundant files in the src/backend and src/tests folders
- Remove any files that are not needed (such as UnitTest1.cs)
- Remove any redundant code
- Ensure that tests still pass after each file cleanup

## Additional comments from user
- Need to maintain compatibility and functionality
- Focus on removing truly unneeded files/code

## Plan
1. **Phase 1: Identify Redundant Files**
   - Task 1.1: [x] Scan for unused test files (like UnitTest1.cs)
   - Task 1.2: [ ] Check for empty or redundant classes

2. **Phase 2: Verify Test Dependencies**
   - Task 2.1: [ ] Run existing tests to establish baseline
   - Task 2.2: [ ] Map test file dependencies

3. **Phase 3: Remove Redundant Test Files**
   - Task 3.1: [ ] Remove identified test files
   - Task 3.2: [ ] Verify tests still pass

4. **Phase 4: Clean Up Request Processing Code**
   - Task 4.1: [ ] Review request processing classes for redundancies
   - Task 4.2: [ ] Remove unnecessary code

5. **Phase 5: Verify Final State**
   - Task 5.1: [ ] Final test run to verify functionality
   - Task 5.2: [ ] Document removed files and code

## Decisions
- UnitTest1.cs files contain actual test implementations and should be renamed rather than deleted
- Will prioritize functionality over removing potentially useful code
- Will take an incremental approach to ensure we don't break anything
