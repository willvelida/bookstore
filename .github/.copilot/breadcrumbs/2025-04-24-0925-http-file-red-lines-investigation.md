# Requirements

- Identify and resolve the issues causing red lines in the `Bookstore.Api.http` file

# Additional comments from user

The user noticed red lines in the Bookstore.Api.http file and wants to understand what's causing them.

# Plan

## Phase 1: Analyze HTTP File
- [x] Task 1.1: Examine the Bookstore.Api.http file content
- [x] Task 1.2: Check if the routes in the HTTP file match the API implementation
- [x] Task 1.3: Verify all endpoint mapping methods are called in Program.cs

## Phase 2: Identify Potential Issues
- [x] Task 2.1: Check for REST Client extension installation and configuration
- [x] Task 2.2: Validate variable definition syntax
- [x] Task 2.3: Check for formatting issues in the HTTP file
- [x] Task 2.4: Verify HTTP methods and headers
- [x] Task 2.5: Test a simple HTTP request format to rule out syntax issues

## Phase 3: Resolve Issues
- [x] Task 3.1: Fix any identified issues by adding quotes around the host address URL
- [ ] Task 3.2: Verify that the red lines are gone

# Decisions

- Approach this systematically by comparing the HTTP file routes with the implemented API endpoints
- Check Program.cs to ensure all endpoint mapping extension methods are called
- Fixed the variable definition by adding quotes around the URL value
- The most likely cause of the red lines was the variable definition syntax

# Implementation Details

We've examined:
1. The Bookstore.Api.http file content
2. The endpoint implementation files (BookEndpoints.cs, ReviewEndpoints.cs)
3. The Program.cs file

The routes in the endpoint implementation files match the routes in the HTTP file, and all endpoint mapping methods are properly called in Program.cs.

The most common cause of red lines in HTTP files is syntax issues with variable definitions. The REST Client extension often requires quotes around string values in variable definitions.

# Changes Made

Updated the Bookstore.Api.http file:
- Changed `@Bookstore.Api_HostAddress = http://localhost:5223` to `@Bookstore.Api_HostAddress = "http://localhost:5223"`
- Added quotes around the URL value to fix the syntax issue

# Before/After Comparison

**Before**: 
```
@Bookstore.Api_HostAddress = http://localhost:5223
```
Red lines appeared in the HTTP file, likely due to the unquoted URL.

**After**: 
```
@Bookstore.Api_HostAddress = "http://localhost:5223"
```
Added quotes around the URL value to fix the syntax issue.
