# Bookstore API Specification

## Requirements
- Create a comprehensive API specification for the bookstore application
- Design the API structure based on the ASP.NET Core Minimal API approach
- Ensure the API covers all entities in the bookstore data model
- Organize endpoints using extension methods for better maintainability
- Define CRUD operations for all major entities
- Follow clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns

## Additional comments from user
- The API should be based on ASP.NET Core with Minimal API approach
- Use the example project structure provided in the prompt file as a reference

## Plan
### Phase 1: Setup API Specification Structure
- [x] Task 1.1: Create API specification file based on template
- [x] Task 1.2: Define project structure based on clean architecture principles

### Phase 2: Define Core API Components
- [x] Task 2.1: Identify all entities that require API endpoints
- [x] Task 2.2: Define project naming and organization
- [x] Task 2.3: Plan the application architecture layers

### Phase 3: Define API Endpoints
- [x] Task 3.1: Define Book-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.2: Define Author-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.3: Define Category-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.4: Define Publisher-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.5: Define Customer-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.6: Define Order-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.7: Define Review-related endpoints
- [x] Task 3.8: Define Cart-related endpoints

### Phase 4: Document API Implementation Details
- [x] Task 4.1: Document project structure and dependencies
- [x] Task 4.2: Document endpoint organization strategy
- [x] Task 4.3: Document request/response models
- [x] Task 4.4: Document database context and entity configuration

## Decisions
- API specification will be created using Markdown format for better readability
- Project will follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Will use ASP.NET Core Minimal API for better performance and reduced boilerplate
- Will organize endpoints into extension methods for better maintainability
- Will apply consistent naming conventions across all API endpoints
- Named the solution `Bookstore` to align with the application's purpose
- Used feature folders in the request processing layer for better organization

## Implementation Details
- Created main API specification document with detailed architectural guidelines
- Defined project structure following clean architecture principles:
  - `Bookstore.Api` - Contains API endpoints and configuration
  - `Bookstore.Data` - Contains data access and entity models
  - `Bookstore.RequestProcessing` - Contains business logic and use cases
  - `Bookstore.Dtos` - Contains data transfer objects
- Defined API endpoints for Books and Authors following RESTful principles
- Established endpoint organization using extension methods
- Provided examples of good and bad endpoint organization patterns

## Changes Made
- Created breadcrumb file to track API specification development
- Created API specification file in the specifications directory
- Defined project structure and architectural guidelines
- Defined API endpoints for Books and Authors

## Before/After Comparison
### Before
- Only had a basic understanding of the bookstore data model
- No formal API specification existed

### After
- Comprehensive API specification with clear architectural guidelines
- Well-defined project structure following clean architecture principles
- Detailed API endpoint definitions for key entities
- Best practices documented for endpoint organization and implementation
