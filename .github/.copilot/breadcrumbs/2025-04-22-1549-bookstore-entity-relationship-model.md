# Adding Bookstore Entity Relationship Model

## Requirements
- Create an entity relationship model for a bookstore application
- Document all entities, their attributes, and relationships
- Include core entities: Book, Author, Category, Publisher, Customer, Order, OrderItem
- Include optional enhancements: Review, Cart, CartItem
- Save the model in the domain knowledge folder for future reference

## Additional comments from user
- The model should provide a foundation for a bookstore e-commerce application
- The relationships between entities should be clearly defined

## Plan
### Phase 1: Setup Directory Structure
- Task 1.1: Verify if domain knowledge folder exists, create it if needed
- Task 1.2: Prepare the entity relationship model content

### Phase 2: Create Entity Relationship Model
- Task 2.1: Document core entities with their attributes and relationships
- Task 2.2: Document optional enhancement entities
- Task 2.3: Summarize entity relationships

### Phase 3: Documentation and Verification
- Task 3.1: Save the entity relationship model to the domain knowledge folder
- Task 3.2: Verify the model is accessible for future reference

## Decisions
- Used Markdown format for better readability and easy updating
- Organized entities into core and optional sections for clarity
- Included emojis for improved visual navigation
- Detailed both attributes and relationships for each entity
- Added a comprehensive entity relationship summary for quick reference

## Implementation Details
- Created a markdown file named `bookstore_data_model.md` in the domain knowledge folder
- Documented 7 core entities: Book, Author, Category, Publisher, Customer, Order, OrderItem
- Documented 3 optional entities: Review, Cart, CartItem
- Each entity includes its attributes with data types and primary/foreign keys
- Each entity includes its relationships with other entities
- Added an entity relationship summary section that details the cardinality between entities

## Changes Made
- Added `.github/.copilot/domain_knowledge/bookstore_data_model.md` with the complete entity relationship model
- Created a breadcrumb file to document the process

## Before/After Comparison
### Before
- No formal entity relationship model existed for the bookstore application
- Domain knowledge was not documented in a centralized location

### After
- Comprehensive entity relationship model is now available in the domain knowledge folder
- Clear documentation of all entities, attributes, and relationships
- Foundation established for future development of the bookstore application

## References
- Domain Knowledge: `.github/.copilot/domain_knowledge/bookstore_data_model.md` - Created as part of this task
- Specification Template: `.github/.copilot/specifications/.template.md` - Referenced for structuring documentation
- Breadcrumb Protocol: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Followed for creating this breadcrumb

## Implementation Checklist
### Phase 1: Setup Directory Structure
- [x] Task 1.1: Verify if domain knowledge folder exists, create it if needed

- [x] Task 3.2: Verify the model is accessible for future reference
  - [x] Confirm the file is saved in the correct location
  - [x] Ensure the file is properly formatted and readable

## Success Criteria
- [x] A comprehensive entity relationship model is created and stored in the domain knowledge folder
- [x] The model includes all core entities (Book, Author, Category, Publisher, Customer, Order, OrderItem)
- [x] The model includes all optional enhancement entities (Review, Cart, CartItem)
- [x] All entity attributes and their data types are clearly documented
- [x] All relationships between entities are explicitly defined with cardinality
- [x] The model is accessible for future reference in the development process
