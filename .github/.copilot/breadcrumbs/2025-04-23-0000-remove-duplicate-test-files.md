# Plan

## Phase 1: Identify Duplicate Test Files

### Task 1.1: Analyze Test File Structure
- [x] Identify all test files in the src/tests directory
- [x] Determine which files are duplicates

Identified duplicate files:
1. BookEndpointsTests.cs - duplicated in root and Endpoints folder of Bookstore.Api.Tests
2. GetBookRequestProcessorTests.cs - duplicated in root and Features/GetBook folder of Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests

### Task 1.2: Compare Content of Duplicate Files
- [x] Examine the content of both BookEndpointsTests.cs files
- [x] Examine the content of both GetBookRequestProcessorTests.cs files
- [x] Determine which files should be retained based on file organization patterns

## Phase 2: Remove Duplicate Files

### Task 2.1: Remove Duplicate BookEndpointsTests.cs
- [ ] After confirming content, remove the duplicate BookEndpointsTests.cs file
- [ ] Keep the one that follows proper organization pattern (likely the one in the Endpoints folder)

### Task 2.2: Remove Duplicate GetBookRequestProcessorTests.cs
- [ ] After confirming content, remove the duplicate GetBookRequestProcessorTests.cs file
- [ ] Keep the one that follows proper organization pattern (likely the one in the Features folder)

## Phase 3: Verify Project Integrity

### Task 3.1: Verify Project References
- [ ] Ensure that removing the files doesn't break any project references
- [ ] Make sure the remaining test files are properly included in the project

# Decisions

Organizational pattern observed:
- Tests in the Bookstore.Api.Tests project are organized in an Endpoints subfolder
- Tests in the Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests project are organized in a Features folder structure

After examining the file contents:
- Both pairs of files have identical test code but use different namespaces that match their folder structure
- The files in organized folders (Endpoints and Features) use more specific namespaces that reflect their location
- Other test files follow the pattern of being organized into subfolders by feature or endpoint

Based on this pattern, we will retain the files in the organized folders (Endpoints and Features) and remove the ones in the root directories to maintain a consistent project structure.
