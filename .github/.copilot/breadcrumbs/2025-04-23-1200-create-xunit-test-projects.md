# Creating xUnit Test Projects for Bookstore API

## Requirements

- Create xUnit test projects for Bookstore.Api and Bookstore.RequestProcessing
- Add test projects to Bookstore solution and place them in src/tests folder
- Implement tests for functionality in both projects
- Ensure tests pass

## Additional comments from user

- Test projects should be called Bookstore.Api.Tests and Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests

## Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Test Projects
- [x] Create test project directories in src/tests
- [x] Initialize xUnit test projects
- [x] Add project references to main projects
- [x] Add test projects to Bookstore solution

### Phase 2: Implement Tests
- [x] Examine the code in Bookstore.Api to identify testable functionality
- [x] Examine the code in Bookstore.RequestProcessing to identify testable functionality
- [x] Create unit tests for Bookstore.RequestProcessing
- [x] Create unit tests for Bookstore.Api
- [x] Create interfaces for better testability

### Phase 3: Validation
- [x] Run tests and verify they pass
- [x] Fix any failing tests
- [x] Document test coverage and results

## Decisions

- Using xUnit as the testing framework as specified in the requirements
- Creating separate test projects for each of the main projects to maintain clear separation of concerns
- Adding project references to the respective main projects to enable testing their functionality
- Created interfaces for better testability:
  - `IBookstoreRepository` - For mocking the repository in RequestProcessor tests
  - `IGetBookRequestProcessor` - For mocking the processor in API tests
- Using TestServer to test API endpoints with a controlled environment

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved these key steps:

1. Creating project structure:
   - Created test project directories
   - Initialized xUnit test projects
   - Added project references and added them to the solution

2. Improving testability:
   - Created `IBookstoreRepository` interface
   - Updated `BookstoreRepository` to implement the interface
   - Created `IGetBookRequestProcessor` interface
   - Updated `GetBookRequestProcessor` to implement the interface
   - Modified tests to use these interfaces for mocking

3. Test implementation:
   - For Bookstore.RequestProcessing:
     - Created tests that mock the repository
     - Tested behavior with existing and non-existing book IDs
   - For Bookstore.Api:
     - Created tests that mock the request processor
     - Set up a test server with controlled environment
     - Tested API endpoints for correct responses

4. Fixing issues:
   - Added routing services to API tests with `services.AddRouting()`
   - Configured endpoints properly for testing

## Changes Made

- Created src/tests/Bookstore.Api.Tests directory
- Created src/tests/Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests directory
- Created Bookstore.Api.Tests.csproj with reference to Bookstore.Api
- Created Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests.csproj with reference to Bookstore.RequestProcessing
- Added both test projects to the Bookstore.sln
- Created IBookstoreRepository.cs in Bookstore.Data
- Updated BookstoreRepository.cs to implement IBookstoreRepository
- Updated GetBookRequestProcessor.cs to use IBookstoreRepository and implement IGetBookRequestProcessor
- Created comprehensive tests for both projects that verify functionality

## Test Results

All tests are now passing:
```
Test summary: total: 4, failed: 0, succeeded: 4, skipped: 0, duration: 1.3s
```

The tests cover:
1. In Bookstore.RequestProcessing.Tests:
   - GetBookRequestProcessor handling of existing book IDs
   - GetBookRequestProcessor handling of non-existing book IDs

2. In Bookstore.Api.Tests:
   - API endpoint returning correct data for existing book IDs
   - API endpoint returning 404 for non-existing book IDs
