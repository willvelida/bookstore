# Requirements

- Test the HTTP endpoints defined in the `Bookstore.Api.http` file
- Verify that the API is responding correctly to requests

# Additional comments from user

The user asked to test all endpoints and ignore any failures, and to look at any errors at the end.

# Plan

## Phase 1: Start the API
- [x] Task 1.1: Start the Bookstore.Api application

## Phase 2: Test HTTP Endpoints
- [x] Task 2.1: Test the Book endpoint
- [x] Task 2.2: Test the Author endpoint
- [x] Task 2.3: Test the Category endpoints
- [x] Task 2.4: Test the Publisher endpoints
- [x] Task 2.5: Test the Customer endpoints
- [x] Task 2.6: Test the Order endpoints
- [x] Task 2.7: Test the Review endpoint
- [x] Task 2.8: Test the Cart endpoint

## Phase 3: Verify and Document Results
- [x] Task 3.1: Document the results of endpoint testing
- [x] Task 3.2: Address any issues encountered during testing

# Decisions

- Used curl commands in the terminal to test each endpoint directly
- Tested all endpoints systematically and documented the results
- Determined that all endpoints are functioning correctly

# Implementation Details

The testing process consisted of sending HTTP requests to each endpoint defined in the Bookstore.Api.http file. Each request was made using curl and the appropriate HTTP method and headers.

Key testing details:
- Used GET requests for all endpoints since they are all read operations
- Set the Accept header to "application/json" for all requests
- Verified the response data for each endpoint to ensure it matched the expected structure and content

# Changes Made

- Started the Bookstore.Api application, which ran on http://localhost:5223
- Tested all 12 endpoints defined in the Bookstore.Api.http file
- No changes were needed as all endpoints functioned correctly

# Before/After Comparison

**Before**: The HTTP file was created but not tested to verify functionality.

**After**: All endpoints in the HTTP file have been verified and confirmed to be working correctly. The testing process demonstrated that each endpoint returns the expected data in the correct format.

# Results Summary

All 12 endpoints tested successfully:
1. GET book by ID: Returned "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
2. GET author by ID: Returned Harper Lee's information
3. GET all categories: Returned all categories (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.)
4. GET category by ID: Returned Category 1 information
5. GET all publishers: Returned all publishers (Penguin Books, etc.)
6. GET publisher by ID: Returned Publisher 1 information
7. GET all customers: Returned all customers (John Doe, etc.)
8. GET customer by ID: Returned Customer 1 information
9. GET all orders: Returned all orders with their items
10. GET order by ID: Returned Order 1 information
11. GET reviews for a book: Returned reviews for Book 1
12. GET customer cart: Returned Customer 1's cart with items

No errors were encountered during the testing process.
