# Dev Container Cleanup

## Requirements
- Remove all configuration in the `.devcontainer` directory
- Keep the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile and associated breadcrumbs
- Document the cleanup process

## Additional comments from user
User wants to revert all changes made to the Dev Container configuration but keep the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile implementation.

## Plan
1. Create a backup of the current `.devcontainer` directory (optional)
2. Remove the `.devcontainer` directory and its contents
3. Keep the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile and associated breadcrumbs intact
4. Document the cleanup process

### Task List
- [x] Create a backup of the current `.devcontainer` directory (optional) - Skipped as not required
- [x] Remove the `.devcontainer` directory and its contents
- [x] Verify that the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile and associated breadcrumbs remain intact
- [x] Document the cleanup process

## Decisions
- Removing the `.devcontainer` configuration will revert to standard local development without containers
- The previously created Bookstore.Api Dockerfile will be kept as it contains the proper configuration for containerizing the API for production deployment

## Implementation Details
The cleanup process involved:

1. Removing the `.devcontainer` directory, which contained:
   - `devcontainer.json`: Contains the Dev Container configuration
   - `Dockerfile`: Used for building the development container
   - `library-scripts/`: Contains scripts used for setting up the development container

2. Keeping the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile (`src/backend/Bookstore.Api/Dockerfile`), which is used for production containerization of the API.

3. Keeping the associated breadcrumbs in `.github/.copilot/breadcrumbs/` directory:
   - `2025-04-24-0701-dockerfile-implementation.md`: Documents the implementation of the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile

## Changes Made
- Removed the `.devcontainer` directory and all its contents using PowerShell commands
- Verified that the Bookstore.Api Dockerfile remains intact and unchanged
- Confirmed that the associated breadcrumb files are maintained

## Before/After Comparison
**Before:**
- `.devcontainer/` directory containing development container configuration
- `src/backend/Bookstore.Api/Dockerfile` for production containerization

**After:**
- `.devcontainer/` directory removed, allowing for standard local development
- `src/backend/Bookstore.Api/Dockerfile` maintained for production containerization
