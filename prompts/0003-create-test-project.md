Help me create a Test Project using the xUnit framework that tests the functionality in the following projects:

- `Bookstore.Api`
- `Bookstore.RequestProcessing`

Create the test projects in a new folder called src/tests. Add them to the `Bookstore` Solution and call the Test Projects `Bookstore.Api.Tests` and `Bookstore.RequestProcessing` respectively.

Once you have created the tests, run them and ensure they pass. Keep iterating on the tests until they have passed.
