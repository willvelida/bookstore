Help me create a ASP.NET Core API project according to the spec. I don't need the database context just yet so we can return a hardcoded response from the request processor.

Create this in a new folder called `src/backend`. Name the Solution `Bookstore` and call the Project `Bookstore.Api`.

Use .NET 9. Use this documentation on instructions of how to add swagger/openapi endpoint: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet9-openapi/
