As a software engineer,
I want to create a Dev Container,
So that I can use a Docker Container as a full-featured development environment.

Ensure that the Dev Container is configured to use .NET 9, and that it can run the API project within the Dev Container.

Use the following documentation as a guide on how to create a Dev Container: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container

Use this tutorial as further context: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial
