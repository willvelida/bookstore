Review the ERD diagram in the `.github/.copilot/domain_knowledge/bookstore_data_model.md` file. Generate an ERD diagram for the current model using Mermaid.js notation.

I am concerned that the current ERD diagram introduces a bug where there's a no composite primary key in many-to-many relationships, so verify that the current data model doesn't introduce this bug and if it does, update the ERD diagram in the `.github/.copilot/domain_knowledge/bookstore_data_model.md` file, with the new Mermaid.js diagram.

Use this diagram as a guide for the new ERD diagram: https://documentation.red-gate.com/dms6/files/49646072/49646073/3/1559655630714/ERDiagramNorthwind.png
